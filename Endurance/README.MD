# Working principles

- Program option 1

1. This program works to transfer the data from a text (.txt) file and transfer it to an excel (.xlsx) file
2. The `config.json` file can then be updated accordingly; by referencing the excel file that is transferred from the text file.

- Program option 2

1. This program works to extract the relevant data (as configured in the `config.json` file)
2. The extracted data would then be formatted into a new excel file (with the prefix `_transfer.xlsx`)
3. The formatted data in the new excel file can be directly copied and pasted in the `OriginPro` software
