1. Have a main function file that stores all the methods related to .xlsx|.csv|.txt file 
2. Have a new .py file for each option methods; this files would be called from the main.py file

==> To work on now:
1. Allow settings of col to read and write using the letters instead of number values ✓
2. Handle permission denied error; when the file to write is open ✓
3. When reading files, allow setting of keywords to read example "D1-initial". This allows matching of names such as "D1-initial-bd-100 hz" or "D1-initial-bd", etc
4. Allow automatic setting of header to write ✓
5. Allow setting of file path from root directory with the "~" prefix; root directory would refer to "\"
6. Log messages on the screen ✓
7. Allow setting of keyword in the config.json such as "bd" or "fail", and would inform user if the files with these text is detected

8. Extracting and transferring data from .txt file
9. Handle if .xlsx file name to write doesn't have .xlsx file extension
10. Same extraction method can be done for .csv files to as the .xls (Directly converting to .xlsx using powershell)
